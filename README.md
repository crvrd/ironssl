This is a toy project.  It aims to be an implementation of SSL in rust.  There are a few goals:

  1. Learning rust.
  2. Getting a handle on how SSL works, from top to bottom.  
  3. Learning the nitty-gritty details of how a lot of common encryption schemes work.  

The purpose is to reinvent the wheel in order to understand the wheel.  As such, this project implements things which should be left to libraries, and probably contains things which should never be done anyway.  I am issuing this warning:

# DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.  IT IS CERTAINLY INSECURE, AND PROBABLY COMPLETELY BROKEN.
